# UP! - the fast way to go up directories in fish

Tired of attaching "balloons" to your `cd` command to go up directories?

`cd ..`, `cd ../..`, `cd ../../..`, `cd ../../../..`, `cd ../../../../../../../../../../../../../..`?

Tired of creating weird aliases like `cd..4`, `cd..12`, ... `cd..100` to navigate up directories?

Now you can use `up`!

Type `up` to go up one directory. Type `up 2` to go up two directories. Type
`up 42` to go up forty-two directories. It's that easy.

No more defining an alias for `cd ../../../../../../..`.  Just type `up 7`.

You can also get the path that `up` will produce by using `upp` (up path).
This lets you type simple commands like `ls (upp 4)` instead of
`ls ../../../..`.

This is the best kind of `up`, where dogs can talk and everyone lives happily
ever after running [fish][fish-shell].
